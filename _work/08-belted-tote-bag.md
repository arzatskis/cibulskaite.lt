The belted minimalist tote bag is crafted with care, using high-quality natural leather. Instead of hiding the unique patterns and imperfections of the leather, I intentionally emphasize them to showcase the beauty of the material. The inclusion of animal scars adds a touch of rawness and authenticity to the design.

I believe that simplicity is key in design, and this tote bag perfectly embodies the "less is more" mantra. It features clean lines, a streamlined silhouette, and minimal detailing. The focus is on the high-quality leather and the natural beauty it possesses.

This hand-made tote bag is versatile and can be styled with a range of outfits, from bohemian-inspired looks to minimalist ensembles. It complements everyday wear effortlessly, adding a touch of sophistication and timeless elegance.

By adhering to the principles of Wabi-Sabi and minimalistic design, I strive to create products that are not only visually pleasing but also have a deeper connection to nature and simplicity. This tote bag is a testament to my design philosophy and represents the beauty that lies in embracing imperfections and simplicity.
