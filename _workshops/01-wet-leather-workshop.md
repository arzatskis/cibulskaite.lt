In my work and designs, I value a minimal, modern approach: clean lines, black tones, and timeless design that speaks to city lovers who want both: pieces that are not only expressive but practival at the same time.

Natural leather is perfect material for this.

In this workshop, you will learn techniques and how to bring it to life, by shaping piece of natural leather into your own, unique, sculptural free flowing tote bag silhouette.

Workshop begins with a short introduction to leather itself: its textures, qualities, and possibilities. You’ll get the chance to touch, cut, and experiment with the material directly with step by step help and guidance.

I'll demononstrate process of sewing with professional leather sewing machine, leather stitching and how construction works.

This workshop is more than just crafting. It’s about slowing down, working with your own hands, exploration and great time in a studio setting nearby Neris river - my studio space where nature and creativity meet.

You will leave with curiosity and anticipation! I will finish your created base with straps and all the final details, then send complete tote bag back to you in a few weeks - once your creation settles and is ready to be finished.

**What's included**<br>

- Learning Techniques of wet leather moulding.
- Intro guide to exploration of cuts, feel and leathers themselves.
- Demonstration of how leather sewing process works.
